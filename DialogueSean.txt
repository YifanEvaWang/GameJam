"Oh, hello there! Always good to see a new face around here!"

>Who are you?
"The name's Sean, and this here is my seap! Hoho!"

"Well sure, I don't get many customers, but there's quite a lot of treasure in these halls."

"Some of them might be useful to you if you want to get out of here, hoho!"
